Core 
-> new virsion of NFT
  old 0.22 SOL
  new 0.037 SOL

Token Metadata -> decimal:0 -> NFT
Core -> optimized for NFT
 (account -> all key data) <-  reduce complexity

Collection Management
 such as royalities and plugins
  -> overridden for individual NFTs

Advanced Plugin Support
-> many utility and customization
 -> life cycle event(create, transfer, burn)

 DAS
 -> automatically indexed and available

 Create 
 -> it's easy and no need Token Metadata

 Collection
-> both nft and collection
- first class asset (collection-level plugin)
-asset-level plugin is high priority

Enforced Royalities

Lifecycle event and plugin
-create
-transfer
-update
-burn
-add plugin
-approve authority plugin
-remove authority plugin
-> these events are handled by plugin 
 -> approve, reject, force approve

Freeze / lock
-> Freeze Delegate, Permanent Freeze Delegate

delegation is easier because store directly on the plugin
-> in during Asset creation or addPluginV1 function

Asset Status
- canBurn
- canTransfer
- canUpdate




Core Asset and Collection contain onchain data and off chain data(uri)
- we can store something mindless rent
- cheap
- flexible

onchain 
guarantees and expectations
off chain
flexible information

0.0015 SOL per Asset mint

Soul-bound token
-> Permanent Freeze Delegate plugin

How to set immutable

 plugin -> lifecycle


==========================

For digital Assets, web3 games, onchain communities

Swap Program(mpl-hybrid)
FT <=> NFT
-> dual escrow system

1 Swapping
NFT -> Liquidity, distribution, DeFi Opportunity
FT -> utility, collectability 

2 Re-rolling
1) enter the escrow wallet -> blank
2) leave the escrow reassign 

creator 
1) limit the trait
2) Fee especially from FT -> NFT

-> add loot box gamification
 -> source of revenue
uniwue limited time traits for
game rewards

doesn't check to see is the uri is already used

250k asset metadata is recommended
